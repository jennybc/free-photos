## free-photos

I [sought advice via Twitter](https://twitter.com/JennyBryan/status/722194630784065538) on how to get photos for talks that are appropriately licensed, w/o undue fuss:

> Seeking deeply pragmatic strategy to find photos that are [1] awesome / funny & [2] licensed s.t. you can actually use them in a talk. Help?

Random funny photo from [\@_inundata](https://twitter.com/_inundata) of indeterminate licensing:

Here's the abundance of riches I got back:

  * do regular [Google image search](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=pygmy+goat) BUT under "Search tools", use the "Usage rights" drop-down to filter for images with various levels of reuse/modification permission, h/t [\@andyteucher](https://twitter.com/andyteucher)
  * use [flickr.com](https://www.flickr.com)
